This is the Readme file for my capstone project

IF you follow these instructions, the project **WILL** Work as I have tested a fresh run of it.

To Run:

- Clone Repo
  
--> Important!!!! <--
- Run an instance of MongoDB in "SKILLS NETWORK TOOLS" and insert password into the db.js file in the server folder
- It should look like this >>> const mongoURI =  "mongodb://root:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@127.0.0.1:27017";

- npm install in the root

- npm install in the server folder

- npm run build in the root

- npm start in the server folder
  
- Launch Application on Port 8181 in the "SKILLS NETWORK TOOLS" tab and go to the address
